            "*Based*? Are you fucking kidding me? I spent a decent portion of my life writing all of that and your response to me is *Based*? Are you so mentally handicapped that the only word you can comprehend is *Based* - or are you just some fucking asshole who thinks that with such a short response, he can make a statement about how meaningless what was written was? Well, I'll have you know that what I wrote was NOT meaningless, in fact, I even had my written work proof-read by several professors of literature! Don't believe me? I doubt you would, and your response to this will probably be *Based* once again! Do I give a fuck? No, does it look like I give even the slightest fuck about five fucking letters? I bet you took the time to type those five letters too, I bet you sat there and chuckled to yourself for 20 hearty seconds before pressing *send*! You're so fucking pathetic! I'm honestly considering directing you to a psychiatrist, but I'm simply far too nice to do something like that! You, however, will go out of your way to make a fool out of someone by responding to a well-thought-out, intelligent, or humorous statement that probably took longer to write than you can last in bed with a chimpanzee! What do I have to say to you? Absolutely nothing! I couldn't be bothered to respond to such a worthless attempt at a response! Do you want *Based* on your gravestone?",
            "What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I‚Äôll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I‚Äôve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills! I am trained in gorilla warfare and I‚Äôm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces! You are nothing to me but just another target! I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words! You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker! As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot! The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life! You‚Äôre fucking dead, kid! I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that‚Äôs just with my bare hands! Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit! If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ‚Äúclever‚Äù comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue! But you couldn‚Äôt, you didn‚Äôt, and now you‚Äôre paying the price, you goddamn idiot! I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it! You‚Äôre fucking dead, kiddo!",
            "Based? Based on what? In your dick? Please shut the fuck up and use words properly you fuckin troglodyte, do you think God gave us a freedom of speech just to spew random words that have no meaning that doesn't even correllate to the topic of the conversation? Like please you always complain about why no one talks to you or no one expresses their opinions on you because you're always spewing random shit like poggers based cringe and when you try to explain what it is and you just say that it's funny like what? What the fuck is funny about that do you think you'll just become a stand-up comedian that will get a standing ovation just because you said *cum* in the stage? HELL NO YOU FUCKIN IDIOT, so please shut the fuck up and use words properly you dumb bitch"
