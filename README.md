# ImpostorBot

A quick discord bot I've been working on in my free time. Current features include replacing certain strings with ascii emojis and resplonding to words with copypastas.

If you'd like to use it, note that you need a config.json file which contains your Bot Token, or you can just replace the reference to the bot token file with your own bot token.
